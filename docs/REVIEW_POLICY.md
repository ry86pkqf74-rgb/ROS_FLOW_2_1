# Review policy

- **No direct pushes to main.** All changes to `main` must go through a pull request.
- **All changes via PR.** Create a branch, open a PR, and merge only after review.
- **AI review check must pass.** The configured AI code-review workflow must succeed before merge.
- **At least 1 approval required.** Every PR needs at least one human (or code owner) approval before it can be merged.

After this policy is in place, all work should go through PRs and receive AI review.
