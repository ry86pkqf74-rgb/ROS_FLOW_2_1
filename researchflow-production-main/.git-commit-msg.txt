feat: Add multi-application integration system for AI-driven parallel task execution

Added 6 External Service Integrations:
- Linear (GraphQL): Issue tracking with AI agent assignment via labels
- Figma (REST): Design file access, component extraction, AI design review
- Docker Hub + Engine: Image management, deployment automation, container control
- Slack (Enhanced): Slash commands, interactive components, bidirectional notifications
- Notion (Expanded): AI task tracking, project planning, deployment logging
- Cursor IDE: Bidirectional communication, code-level agent triggers

Service Implementation (services/orchestrator/src/services/):
- linearService.ts: 15 functions for issue management, webhooks, AI agent labels
- figmaService.ts: 12 functions for design sync, comments, token extraction
- dockerRegistryService.ts: Docker Hub API + Engine API with DockerEngineClient class
- slackService.ts: 15 functions with slash command handling, interactive components
- notionService.ts: 10 functions for task tracking, project planning, cross-tool sync
- multiToolOrchestrator.ts: EventEmitter-based parallel execution with dependency graphs

Integration Infrastructure:
- routes/integrations.ts: 8 webhook endpoints with signature verification + SSE streaming
- packages/cursor-integration/: Standalone NPM package with TypeScript definitions
- infrastructure/n8n/workflows/: 4 automation templates (design-sync, task-automation, deployment, multi-agent)

Documentation & Setup:
- INTEGRATION_SETUP_GUIDE.md: 400+ line comprehensive setup guide
- INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md: Quick start reference with usage examples
- INTEGRATION_ARCHITECTURE.md: System architecture with ASCII diagrams
- .env.integrations.example: Complete environment configuration template (80+ variables)
- install-integrations.sh: Automated installation and verification script

Features:
- Webhook signature verification (HMAC-SHA256 for Linear/Slack, passcode for Figma)
- Parallel AI agent execution with dependency management
- 4 pre-built workflows: full-deployment, design-to-code, issue-to-deployment, parallel-ai-review
- BullMQ job queues with priority scheduling and retry strategies
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time progress streaming to Cursor IDE
- Cross-tool synchronization (Linear to Notion, Figma to Cursor)
- Comprehensive error handling and validation with Zod schemas

Enables parallel AI agent task execution across Notion, Figma, Linear, Slack, Docker, and Cursor for automated full-stack development workflows.
