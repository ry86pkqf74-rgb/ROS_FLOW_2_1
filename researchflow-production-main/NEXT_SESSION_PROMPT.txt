Continue SupplementaryMaterialAgent implementation - Phase 2: Core Agent.

CONTEXT:
- Phase 1 complete: Type definitions in supplementary_types.py (committed to main)
- Repository uses LangGraphBaseAgent pattern from services/worker/src/agents/base/
- Follow existing patterns from manuscript/agent.py
- State management via AgentState (from base/state.py)
- All LLM calls through self.call_llm() for PHI compliance

TASK:
Create services/worker/agents/writing/supplementary_material_agent.py

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Inherit from LangGraphBaseAgent
2. Handle stage 16 (after Results Refinement)
3. Implement 8 core nodes:
   - identify_supplementary_content (determine main vs supplement)
   - organize_supplementary_tables (S1, S2 numbering)
   - organize_supplementary_figures (S1, S2 numbering)
   - compile_extended_methods (detailed protocols)
   - generate_data_statement (data availability)
   - create_appendices (forms, checklists)
   - package_materials (manifest generation)
   - quality_gate (validation)

4. Build LangGraph with parallel processing for tables/figures/methods
5. Implement get_quality_criteria() method
6. Add custom _evaluate_criterion() for supplementary-specific checks
7. Use async/await patterns consistently
8. Include comprehensive docstrings
9. Follow type hints throughout

REFERENCE FILES:
- services/worker/agents/writing/supplementary_types.py (already created)
- services/worker/src/agents/base/langgraph_base.py (base class)
- services/worker/src/agents/manuscript/agent.py (pattern reference)

CONSIDERATIONS:
- Journal-specific formatting (NEJM, JAMA, PLOS, etc.)
- File size limits and validation
- Cross-reference checking
- STROBE/CONSORT checklist integration
- Automated numbering (S1, S2, etc.)
- Manifest generation with file descriptions

Start with the core agent class structure and first 3 nodes, then we'll iterate.
