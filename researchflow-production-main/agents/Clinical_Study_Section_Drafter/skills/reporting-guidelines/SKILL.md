## CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials)

**Applies to**: Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)
**Latest version**: CONSORT 2010 (with extensions for various trial designs)

### Results Section Checklist

| Item # | Topic | Requirement | Example Language |
|---|---|---|---|
| 13a | Participant flow | Report numbers of participants randomly assigned, received intended treatment, and analyzed for the primary outcome, for each group. Ideally reference a flow diagram. | "Of the 500 participants randomized, 248 were assigned to the intervention group and 252 to the control group [Figure 1]." |
| 13b | Losses/exclusions | For each group, report losses and exclusions after randomization, together with reasons. | "Fifteen participants (6.0%) in the intervention group and 12 (4.8%) in the control group were lost to follow-up; reasons included withdrawal of consent (n=10), relocation (n=8), and adverse events (n=9)." |
| 14a | Recruitment | Dates defining the periods of recruitment and follow-up. | "Participants were recruited between March 2022 and September 2023, with a final follow-up date of March 2024." |
| 14b | Trial end | Why the trial ended or was stopped. | "The trial was stopped at the pre-planned interim analysis after demonstrating efficacy crossing the O'Brien-Fleming boundary." |
| 15 | Baseline data | A table showing baseline demographic and clinical characteristics for each group. | "Baseline characteristics were similar between groups [Table 1]." |
| 16 | Numbers analyzed | For each group, number of participants included in each analysis. State whether analysis was by intention-to-treat. Report results of any other analysis (e.g., per-protocol). | "The primary analysis was performed on the intention-to-treat population (n=500). A per-protocol analysis (n=462) yielded consistent results." |
| 17a | Outcomes/estimation | For each primary and secondary outcome, results for each group, the estimated effect size and its precision (95% CI). | "The primary endpoint of HbA1c reduction was **-1.2% (95% CI: -1.5 to -0.9; p<0.001)** in the intervention group compared to **-0.4% (95% CI: -0.7 to -0.1; p=0.02)** in the control group, with a between-group difference of **-0.8% (95% CI: -1.2 to -0.4; p<0.001)**." |
| 17b | Binary outcomes | For binary outcomes, present both absolute and relative effect sizes. | "The event rate was 12.5% in the intervention group vs. 22.0% in the control group (RR 0.57, 95% CI: 0.38–0.85; ARR 9.5%, 95% CI: 3.2–15.8%; NNT 11)." |
| 18 | Ancillary analyses | Results of any other analyses performed, including subgroup analyses and adjusted analyses, distinguishing pre-specified from exploratory. | "In the pre-specified subgroup analysis by age (<65 vs. ≥65 years), the treatment effect was consistent (interaction p=0.42)." |
| 19 | Harms | All important harms or unintended effects in each group. | "Serious adverse events occurred in 8 (3.2%) intervention participants and 5 (2.0%) control participants. The most common adverse event was nausea (intervention: 15.3%; control: 4.8%)." |

### Discussion Section Checklist

| Item # | Topic | Requirement | Example Language |
|---|---|---|---|
| 20 | Limitations | Trial limitations, addressing sources of potential bias, imprecision, and multiplicity of analyses. | "This study has several limitations. First, the open-label design may have introduced performance bias. Second, the relatively short follow-up period (12 months) limits assessment of long-term outcomes." |
| 21 | Generalizability | Generalizability (external validity, applicability) of the trial findings. | "The predominantly Caucasian study population (82%) may limit generalizability to other racial and ethnic groups." |
| 22 | Interpretation | Interpretation consistent with results, balancing benefits and harms, and considering other relevant evidence. | "These findings are consistent with previous meta-analyses suggesting [intervention] reduces [outcome] (Smith et al., 2021). However, the observed increase in gastrointestinal adverse events warrants careful patient selection." |

### Common Pitfalls
- Failing to report losses to follow-up with reasons
- Reporting only p-values without confidence intervals or effect sizes
- Not distinguishing pre-specified from post-hoc subgroup analyses
- Omitting harms/safety data entirely
- Not stating whether ITT or per-protocol analysis was primary

---

## STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology)

**Applies to**: Cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies
**Latest version**: STROBE 2007

### Results Section Checklist

| Item # | Topic | Requirement | Example Language |
|---|---|---|---|
| 13a | Participants | Report numbers of individuals at each stage of study (e.g., potentially eligible, examined for eligibility, confirmed eligible, included, completing follow-up, analyzed). | "Of 2,340 potentially eligible patients, 1,856 met inclusion criteria. After excluding 124 with incomplete data, 1,732 were included in the final analysis." |
| 13b | Non-participation | Give reasons for non-participation at each stage. | "Reasons for exclusion included incomplete medical records (n=78), withdrawal of consent (n=31), and loss to follow-up (n=15)." |
| 13c | Flow diagram | Consider providing a flow diagram. | "[Figure 1] shows the flow of participants through the study." |
| 14a | Descriptive data | Characteristics of participants (demographics, clinical, social), information on exposures and confounders. | "Participant characteristics are presented in [Table 1]. The mean age was 62.4 years (SD 11.2), and 58% were female." |
| 14b | Missing data | Indicate number of participants with missing data for each variable. | "Missing data ranged from 0.5% (age) to 8.2% (smoking status). Multiple imputation was used to handle missing values." |
| 15 | Outcome data | Report numbers of outcome events or summary measures over time. | "During a median follow-up of 4.2 years (IQR: 3.1–5.8), 234 incident cardiovascular events were recorded." |
| 16a | Main results | Give unadjusted estimates and, if applicable, confounder-adjusted estimates with precision. Make clear which confounders were adjusted for and why. | "In the unadjusted analysis, exposure was associated with increased risk (OR 2.14, 95% CI: 1.62–2.83). After adjustment for age, sex, smoking, and BMI, the association remained significant (aOR 1.78, 95% CI: 1.31–2.42)." |
| 16b | Continuous variables | If relevant, consider translating estimates of relative risk into meaningful time periods. | "The hazard ratio per 10 mmHg increase in systolic blood pressure was 1.15 (95% CI: 1.08–1.23)." |
| 17 | Other analyses | Report other analyses done — subgroup, interaction, sensitivity analyses. | "Sensitivity analyses excluding participants with prevalent diabetes at baseline yielded similar results (aOR 1.72, 95% CI: 1.22–2.43)." |

### Discussion Section Checklist

| Item # | Topic | Requirement | Example Language |
|---|---|---|---|
| 18 | Key results | Summarize key results with reference to study objectives. | "In this prospective cohort study, we found that [exposure] was independently associated with a 78% increased odds of [outcome], consistent with our primary hypothesis." |
| 19 | Limitations | Discuss limitations, including sources of potential bias and the direction and magnitude of potential bias. | "Residual confounding from unmeasured lifestyle factors cannot be excluded. The use of self-reported exposure data may have introduced misclassification bias, likely biasing results toward the null." |
| 20 | Interpretation | Give a cautious overall interpretation considering objectives, limitations, multiplicity, and similar studies. | "While these observational findings suggest an association, causal inference is limited. Our results align with those of [previous study] but contrast with [conflicting study], potentially due to differences in population characteristics." |
| 21 | Generalizability | Discuss the generalizability (external validity) of the study results. | "As participants were recruited from a single tertiary care center, findings may not be generalizable to primary care settings." |

### Common Pitfalls
- Not reporting both unadjusted AND adjusted estimates
- Failing to specify which confounders were adjusted for and the rationale
- Using causal language for observational findings
- Not reporting the amount of missing data
- Omitting a flow diagram of participants

## STARD (Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies)

**Applies to**: Diagnostic accuracy studies
**Latest version**: STARD 2015

### Results Section Checklist

| Item # | Topic | Requirement | Example Language |
|---|---|---|---|
| 19 | Flow of participants | Report the flow of participants using a diagram, including the number with the target condition and without. | "Of 450 participants who received both the index test and reference standard, 128 (28.4%) had the target condition confirmed [Figure 1]." |
| 20 | Baseline demographics | Baseline demographics of the study participants. | "Participant characteristics are shown in [Table 1]. The median age was 57 years, and 54% were male." |
| 21a | Severity distribution | Distribution of severity of disease in those with the target condition. | "Among participants with confirmed [disease], severity was classified as mild (32%), moderate (45%), and severe (23%)." |
| 21b | Alternative diagnoses | Distribution of alternative diagnoses in those without the target condition. | "Among participants without [disease], alternative diagnoses included [condition A] (28%), [condition B] (15%), and no identifiable pathology (57%)." |
| 22 | Time interval | Time interval and any clinical interventions between index test and reference standard. | "The median interval between the index test and reference standard was 3 days (IQR: 1–7). No relevant clinical interventions occurred between tests." |
| 23 | Cross-tabulation | Cross-tabulation of the index test results by the results of the reference standard. | "The 2×2 cross-tabulation of results is shown in [Table 2]." |
| 24 | Diagnostic accuracy | Estimates of diagnostic accuracy and their precision (95% CI). | "The sensitivity of the index test was **87.5% (95% CI: 80.7–92.5%)** and specificity was **92.2% (95% CI: 88.6–95.0%)**. The positive predictive value was 81.8% (95% CI: 74.3–87.7%) and negative predictive value was 94.9% (95% CI: 91.8–97.0%)." |
| 25 | Adverse events | Any adverse events from performing the index test or reference standard. | "No serious adverse events were reported. Minor bruising at the venipuncture site occurred in 12 (2.7%) participants." |

### Discussion Section Checklist

| Item # | Topic | Requirement | Example Language |
|---|---|---|---|
| 26 | Limitations | Study limitations including sources of potential bias, statistical uncertainty, and generalizability. | "Limitations include the single-center design and the use of a convenience sample, which may have introduced spectrum bias. The relatively high disease prevalence (28%) may limit applicability to lower-prevalence settings." |
| 27 | Implications | Implications for practice, including the intended use and clinical role of the index test. | "These results suggest that [test] could serve as an effective triage tool in [clinical setting], potentially reducing the need for [invasive procedure] by [X]%." |

### Common Pitfalls
- Not providing a participant flow diagram
- Reporting sensitivity/specificity without confidence intervals
- Failing to describe the time interval between index and reference tests
- Not reporting the spectrum of disease severity
- Omitting adverse events from testing

## PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses)

**Applies to**: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses
**Latest version**: PRISMA 2020

### Results Section Checklist

| Item # | Topic | Requirement | Example Language |
|---|---|---|---|
| 16a | Study selection | Describe the results of the search and selection process, ideally with a flow diagram. | "The search identified 3,245 records. After removing 876 duplicates, 2,369 titles and abstracts were screened. Of these, 187 full-text articles were assessed, and 34 studies met the inclusion criteria [Figure 1]." |
| 16b | Excluded studies | Cite studies that were close to meeting inclusion but excluded, and explain why. | "Twelve studies were excluded after full-text review: 5 for insufficient follow-up duration, 4 for non-comparable interventions, and 3 for duplicate patient populations." |
| 17 | Study characteristics | Cite each included study and present its characteristics. | "Characteristics of the 34 included studies are presented in [Table 1]. Publication years ranged from 2005 to 2024, sample sizes ranged from 42 to 12,450, and 26 studies (76%) were RCTs." |
| 18 | Risk of bias | Present assessments of risk of bias for each included study. | "Risk of bias assessments are shown in [Figure 2] and [Table S1]. Overall, 18 studies (53%) were rated as low risk of bias, 11 (32%) as moderate, and 5 (15%) as high." |
| 19 | Individual results | For all outcomes, present for each study: a summary of results, preferably with a forest plot. | "Individual study results are presented in the forest plot [Figure 3]." |
| 20a | Synthesis results | For each synthesis, briefly summarize the characteristics and risk of bias; present results with meta-analytic estimate, CI, and measures of heterogeneity. | "The pooled effect estimate was **OR 0.72 (95% CI: 0.58–0.89; p=0.003)**. Heterogeneity was moderate (I²=54%, τ²=0.08, p for heterogeneity=0.02)." |
| 20b | Subgroup/sensitivity | Present results of subgroup or sensitivity analyses and meta-regressions. | "In subgroup analysis by study design, the effect was significant for RCTs (OR 0.65, 95% CI: 0.49–0.86) but not for observational studies (OR 0.88, 95% CI: 0.62–1.25; p for interaction=0.12)." |
| 21 | Reporting biases | Present assessments of risk of bias due to missing results (e.g., publication bias). | "Visual inspection of the funnel plot [Figure 4] suggested slight asymmetry; however, Egger's test was not statistically significant (p=0.14)." |
| 22 | Certainty of evidence | Present assessments of certainty of evidence for each outcome. | "Using the GRADE framework, the certainty of evidence was rated as moderate for the primary outcome, downgraded due to inconsistency." |

### Discussion Section Checklist

| Item # | Topic | Requirement | Example Language |
|---|---|---|---|
| 23a | Interpretation | Provide a general interpretation of results in the context of other evidence. | "Our meta-analysis provides moderate-certainty evidence that [intervention] reduces [outcome], consistent with current guideline recommendations." |
| 23b | Limitations of evidence | Discuss limitations of the evidence included in the review. | "The evidence base is limited by the predominance of single-center studies and heterogeneity in outcome definitions." |
| 23c | Limitations of review | Discuss limitations of the review processes used. | "Limitations of this review include restriction to English-language publications and the inability to obtain individual patient data." |
| 23d | Implications | Discuss implications of the results for practice, policy, and future research. | "These findings support the use of [intervention] in [population]. Future research should prioritize multi-center RCTs with standardized outcome measures." |

### Common Pitfalls
- Incomplete PRISMA flow diagram
- Not reporting heterogeneity statistics (I², τ², Q-test)
- Omitting risk of bias assessment
- Not distinguishing between pre-specified and post-hoc subgroup analyses
- Failing to assess publication bias
- Not using GRADE or equivalent certainty assessment

| 12 | Discussion | Strengths and limitations, relevant medical literature, rationale for conclusions. | "This case illustrates [key finding]. Strengths include the detailed longitudinal follow-up. Limitations include the inherent inability to establish causality from a single case." |
| 13 | Patient perspective | The patient's perspective or experience (when available). | "The patient reported significant improvement in quality of life and expressed satisfaction with the treatment approach." |

### Common Pitfalls
- Omitting a clear timeline
- Not discussing the diagnostic reasoning process
- Missing follow-up information
- Not acknowledging the limited generalizability of a single case
- Failing to cite relevant literature in the discussion

## Cross-Cutting Statistical Reporting Standards

Regardless of guideline, all clinical manuscript sections should:

1. **Report exact values** — never round, estimate, or fabricate numbers
2. **Include confidence intervals** — 95% CI for all key estimates
3. **Report p-values** — with exact values (p=0.032, not p<0.05) when possible
4. **Distinguish significance types** — statistical significance ≠ clinical significance
5. **Present both absolute and relative measures** — especially for binary outcomes (RR, OR, ARR, NNT)
6. **Report measures of heterogeneity** — for meta-analyses (I², τ², Q-test p-value)
7. **Use standard notation** — "HR 0.72 (95% CI: 0.58–0.89; p=0.003)"
