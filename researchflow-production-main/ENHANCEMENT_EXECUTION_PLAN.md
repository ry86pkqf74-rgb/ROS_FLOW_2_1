## 🔄 ITERATIVE EXECUTION STRATEGY

Each phase follows:
1. **Plan** - Review requirements and approach
2. **Implement** - Code changes with best practices
3. **Test** - Validate functionality
4. **Stage** - Git add changes
5. **Commit** - Descriptive commit message
6. **Push** - Update remote repository

**Rollback Strategy:** Each commit is atomic and can be reverted independently

## 🎯 DECISION: PROCEEDING WITH ENHANCED PLAN

Implementing security fixes + citation network completion + basic integration testing.
This builds on the excellent foundation while addressing critical gaps.
