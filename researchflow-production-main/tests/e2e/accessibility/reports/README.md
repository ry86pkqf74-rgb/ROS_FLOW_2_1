# Accessibility Test Reports

WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility scan results are written here by the E2E accessibility suite.

## Files

- **a11y-results.json** – Generated by `axe-core.spec.ts` when the "generate accessibility report data" test runs. Contains per-page violation counts (critical, serious) and timestamp. Used for CI and trend tracking.
- **report-template.html** – HTML template that loads `a11y-results.json` (if present) and displays a summary. Open in a browser after running the a11y suite to view results.

## CI

The main Playwright HTML report (`playwright-report/`) and JSON (`playwright-report/results.json`) also contain accessibility test results. To upload the a11y JSON separately, add an artifact step in your workflow:

```yaml
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: a11y-reports
    path: tests/e2e/accessibility/reports/
```

## Running

```bash
npm run test:a11y
# or
npx playwright test tests/e2e/accessibility --project=accessibility
```
