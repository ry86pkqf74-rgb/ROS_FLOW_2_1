**Script:**

[INTRO - 30 seconds]
*"Ready for your first analysis? In this video, we'll analyze real clinical trial data using a complete step-by-step workflow. By the end, you'll have conducted a professional statistical analysis and generated a publication-ready report."*

[MAIN CONTENT - 7 minutes]

**Section 1: Data Upload (2 minutes)**
*"We'll start with a COVID-19 treatment study dataset. To upload data, simply drag and drop your CSV or Excel file, or click 'Upload Dataset' to browse for files."*

[Demonstrate: File upload process, data preview]

*"Notice how the system immediately analyzes your data quality, identifies variable types, and flags any potential issues. This automatic quality assessment helps catch problems before they affect your analysis."*

[Show: Data quality dashboard, column analysis, recommendations]

**Section 2: Analysis Configuration (3 minutes)**
*"Now let's configure our analysis. We want to compare recovery times between treatment and control groups, so we'll use an independent samples t-test."*

[Navigate through tabs:]

*"In Test Selection, we choose 'Independent Samples t-test' because we're comparing means between two independent groups. The system provides clear guidance on when to use each test."*

[Show test selection with descriptions]

*"In Variables, we assign 'recovery_time' as our dependent variable and 'treatment_group' as our grouping variable. The system validates these choices in real-time."*

[Demo variable assignment]

*"In Options, we'll use a 95% confidence level and two-tailed test - the recommended defaults for most analyses."*

[Show options configuration]

*"Finally, Review shows our complete configuration. Always double-check this before running your analysis."*

**Section 3: Results Interpretation (2 minutes)**
*"Let's run the analysis and interpret the results. The Summary tab gives us the key findings in plain language - our treatment significantly reduced recovery time with a medium effect size."*

[Show results interpretation, effect size]

*"The Descriptive tab shows detailed statistics for each group, and the Inferential tab provides the complete statistical test results with confidence intervals."*

[CONCLUSION - 30 seconds]
*"Congratulations! You've completed your first professional statistical analysis. In the next video, we'll explore different types of analyses and when to use them."*
