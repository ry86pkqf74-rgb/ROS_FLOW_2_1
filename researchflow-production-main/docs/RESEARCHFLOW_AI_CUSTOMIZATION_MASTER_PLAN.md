# ResearchFlow AI Customization - Master Execution Plan

**Created:** January 30, 2026
**Version:** 1.0
**Orchestrator:** Claude Cowork + Multi-Agent System
**Repository:** github.com/ry86pkqf74-rgb/researchflow-production

---

## Executive Summary

This master plan integrates the ResearchFlow AI Customization Execution Plan with available MCP connectors, AI tools, and current project status. It migrates the codebase from general API calls to custom agents, fine-tuned models, and expanded RAG pipelines.

**Goal:** Improve task-specific performance, reduce vendor dependency, lower costs, and enable offline capabilities while maintaining HIPAA/PHI compliance.
