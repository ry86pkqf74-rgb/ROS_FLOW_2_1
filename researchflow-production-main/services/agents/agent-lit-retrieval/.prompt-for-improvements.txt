You are a code reviewer. Review this FastAPI literature retrieval agent (agent-lit-retrieval).

Service: POST /agents/run/sync returns papers from PubMed or DEMO fixtures; POST /agents/run/stream is an SSE stub. Code lives in app/main.py, app/retrieval.py, app/schemas.py, app/pubmed_client.py.

Give exactly 2 concrete improvements. For each: (1) one-line title, (2) 1-2 sentence rationale, (3) code snippet only (no explanation). Focus on: input validation, error handling, or request_id propagation in logs. Output format:

IMPROVEMENT 1: <title>
<rationale>
```python
<code>
```

IMPROVEMENT 2: <title>
<rationale>
```python
<code>
```
