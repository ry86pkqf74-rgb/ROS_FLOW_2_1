# ResearchFlow Frontend Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env.local and update values for your environment

# ============================================
# API Server Configuration
# ============================================
# IMPORTANT: These variables are BAKED INTO the frontend at BUILD TIME
# They cannot be changed after the Docker image is built.
#
# FOR DEVELOPMENT (localhost):
#   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
#   VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
#
# FOR PRODUCTION (Docker with Nginx proxy):
#   VITE_API_URL=
#   VITE_API_BASE_URL=
#   (Empty strings mean the frontend uses relative URLs like /api/...
#    which Nginx then proxies to the backend container)
#
# NEVER set these to "orchestrator:3001" or other Docker-internal
# hostnames - the browser cannot resolve those addresses!

VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001

# WebSocket URL for real-time features (same rules as above)
# Development: ws://localhost:3001
# Production: (empty for relative WebSocket connections)
VITE_WS_URL=ws://localhost:3001
