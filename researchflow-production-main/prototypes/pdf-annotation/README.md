# PDF Annotation Prototype

## Purpose

Explore PDF viewing and annotation capabilities:
- PDF rendering options (PDF.js, react-pdf)
- Highlight and selection interactions
- Annotation persistence
- Search within document
- Page navigation

## Status

🔲 **Not Started**

## Key Questions to Answer

1. Which PDF library offers best performance?
2. How to handle large documents (100+ pages)?
3. What annotation types to support? (highlight, comment, link)
4. How to sync annotations across collaborators?

## Requirements

- Must work with research papers (tables, figures, equations)
- Support for highlighting text
- Side panel for annotation list
- Export annotations (JSON, markdown)

## Mock Data States

- Sample PDF documents in various sizes
- Pre-existing annotations
- Different user roles (viewer, editor, reviewer)

## Graduation Criteria

- [ ] Library decision documented
- [ ] Basic highlight/comment working
- [ ] Navigation (page, search, outline) implemented
- [ ] Performance acceptable for 100-page documents
- [ ] Stakeholder approval received
