**Protocol Number:** PILOT-DEMO-2024-003
**Principal Investigator:** Dr. Lisa Chang, PharmD, PhD
**Study Type:** Pilot Study
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** February 04, 2026

## Study Rationale

This pilot study is designed to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and preliminary efficacy of the proposed intervention before conducting a larger definitive trial.

## Objectives

### Primary Objective
To assess feasibility and acceptability of a mobile app-based medication adherence intervention

### Pilot-Specific Objectives
Evaluate user engagement, technical feasibility, and preliminary efficacy signals

### Feasibility Endpoints
App usage >70%, retention rate >85%, technical issues <5%

## Study Methods

### Study Design
Single-arm, open-label pilot study

### Participants
**Target Sample Size:** 50 participants
**Population:** Volunteer participants meeting study criteria

### Intervention
Participants will receive the study intervention for the specified duration with regular monitoring.

### Duration
